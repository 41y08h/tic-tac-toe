# Helooo contributers!

First of all, this project is divided into two parts for ease, if you are confused a bit about how to contribute, take a look at this backend-end part of this project
[Front-end repo](https://github.com/41y08h/TicTacToeAPI)

## Tech stacks:
  React with Socket.io-client
  
  
## How you can contribute?
You can begin by doing code analysis of this codebase and start adding your contributions in form of classes or little helper functions that can make the infrastructure easy to maintain!


#### Yet it's a simple project but it's also simple and easy to maintain ! :)

## Present primary goal of contribution:
  Make the codebase maintainable.
  
## Best practices:
  ### Please do not make comments for obvious syntax! A big noooooo for things like -
    // Port number to start server from
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001
    
  
  ### Do comment for unobvious things or to make it more easy. Something like -
    // Space available, throw user in room
    lastRoom.addUser(socket, (err) => {...}
    
  ### Common sense!
    This is very uncommon in some people :(
    
  
Thanks for viewing this codebase. Looking for your PR :)
